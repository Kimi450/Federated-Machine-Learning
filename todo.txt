We will start with a dataset of sensor data about hand gestures and, as a way of beginning our ML journey, we will learn a single model (in traditional fashion) from all the data to predict which hand gesture is depicted. Then we will implement Google's federated learning, as above, on this data. Then, there are a number of possible extensions to the work. One is to implement some new ideas that I have had for averaging the models. Another is to move to more challenging datasets from the domain of human activity recognition, which will need use of more complex neural networks for the learning.


I also recommend that you have a recent NVIDIA GPU on your machine, such as a
TITAN X. This isn’t required, but it will make your experience better by allowing you
to run the code examples several times faster. See section 3.3 for more information
about setting up a deep-learning workstation.
 If you don’t have access to a local workstation with a recent NVIDIA GPU, you can
use a cloud environment, instead. In particular, you can use Google Cloud instances
(such as an n1-standard-8 instance with an NVIDIA Tesla K80 add-on) or Amazon Web
Services (AWS) GPU instances (such as a p2.xlarge instance). Appendix B presents in
detail one possible cloud workflow that runs an AWS instance via Jupyter notebooks,
accessible in your browser.


impute for the gestures

do it for users

Make notes in jupyter notebook
Reference need to be colleceted
Data needs to be
maybe bad to have too much accuracy. hard to see if the federated approach makes a diff
what imputation was used

Models to make
    traditional model learning from all data
    googles federated learning
        each user builds a model locally and shares the parameters that get learned. Centrally, the parameters are averaged and the averages are sent back to the users, who can incorporate them into the next round of local learning.
