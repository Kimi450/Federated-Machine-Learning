                        Imagine a song collection. The goal is to construct a tour: a playlist that plays each song exactly once. But there must be something that connects consecutive
                        songs in the tour. And each connection must be fun!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar idea features in the <i>Radcliffe &amp; Maconie Radio Show</i> on BBC Radio 6. In a slot called <i>The Chain</i>, listeners submit
                        suggestions for the next song in the chain and how it connects with the previous song. Radcliffe &amp; Maconie choose from the submissions. You can
                        see the kind of links in <a href="https://www.thechain.uk/">The Chain Archive</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this project, we will start with developing a suite of ways of finding connections between songs. Songs might share a word in their titles or their 
                        lyrics, for example. Better still, links might be less direct, e.g. the title of one song and the name of the artist of the other song share a word; or the album on which one song appears shares a word with the title of the next song. Or they might be linked conceptually, e.g. both titles are about time. Or they might be linked by shared
                        band members. And so on! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One bit of fun will be to run an experiment in which we select two consecutive songs from Radcliffe &amp; Maconie's <a href="https://www.thechain.uk/">Chain Archive</a> and, side-by-side, we present the Radcliffe &amp; Maconie link (from their listeners) and our best link (from our suite of methods). Participants in the experiment will tell us which of the two links is better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we have a good suite of methods, we will then develop the software that constructs the tours. In one sense, this is a Traveling Salesperson Problem,
                        with edge costs being inversely related to link quality. But, we might want to formulate this problem a little differently. For example, a tour's quality
                        might be improved by its diversity of links as well as the quality of each individual link. It's less desirable, for example, to use the same kind of
                        link twice in a row.

                            sites to obtain lyrics. It will involve using WordNet to find conceptual relationships. It will involve mastering SPARQL to access DBpedia to obtain linked data about songs, albums, artists. It will
                            involve finding paths in graphs to connect items. It will involve implementing TSP algorithms. And it will involve packaging the whole lot

                        Everyone knows <i>Space Invaders</i>. But what about <i>InvaderZ</i>? This was developed by a guy called Victor Ribeiro. Play it <a href="https://victorribeiro.com/invaderz/">here</a>. InvaderZ uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the invaders. Their fitness is determined by how long they last. The fittest have most influence over the next generation of invaders. His code is <a href="https://github.com/victorqribeiro/invaderz">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ribeiro's implementation is quite simple. Genetics determines invader shape. In this project, we'll take this to the next level. We'll equip each invader with a limited ability to sense the world. Then genetics can determine behaviour (movement).

                        More ambitious students might do one of the following: change to a more complicated game; look at the connection with deep learning and reinforcement learning; consider a more general implementation that uses Grammatical Evolution; or investigate the evolution of forms of cooperation between
                        different invaders.

                        Users will still have profiles that detail their interests. Users will still swipe right and left to like and dislike. And they will still
                        go on dates with their chosen 'partners'. During these dates, they will learn more about their 'partner'. Afterwards, they can rate their date. There
                        may be follow-up dates. Or their ratings may help to improve the next set of recommendations.

                        The difference is that 'dates' will be works of art. Hence, our app will function as an artwork recommender. It will stimulate the brain, rather

                        You're trying to decide which of the movies at your local cineplex to go and see. A recommender system can help you. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm interested in novel ways of looking at recommendation; for example, Sam Banks and colleagues formulated it as a game [Banks et al. 2015].
                        In this project, we develop a novel form of recommender system that formulates it as a Balloon Debate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a normal Balloon Debate, a small number of speakers pretend to be famous people who are overloading the basket of a hot-air balloon. Someone must
                        be thrown overboard. Each speaker gives reasons why they should be saved. An audience must decide who to sacrifice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How can we turn this into a recommender system? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will develop a suite of methods for justifying why a movie should be recommended to a person.
                        For example, the candidate movie stars an actor who also stars in several of the movies in the user's profile; similarly, the candidate may have the
                        same director as movies in the user's profile. Or the genre of the candidate may be one that the user likes. And so  on. We will want to come up with lots
                        of such justification-methods. One source of ideas is [Herlocker et al. 2000].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start of the Debate, each candidate will marshal as many justifications as it can. Then the Debate proceeds in a number of cycles. In each cycle, each candidate selects its best justification and presents it to the user. Sometimes the best justification will be the 'strongest' (assuming we can find a way of ranking the justifications). But other times, the best justification might attempt to be a rebuttal of another candidate's justification. In each cycle, the user will have the option of ejecting a candidate. This proceeds until only one candidate remains.

                    <p>
                        In recent work, my PhD student Arpit Rana and I developed an interactive recommender system which operates by what we call Navigation-by-Preference.
                        Its goal is to allow a user to obtain recommendations that are in tune with her long-term tastes and interests but which also take into
                        account her short-term tastes and interests. For example, generally the user likes documentaries, but tonight she is in the mood for something
                        lighter; or, generally she likes gross-out comedies but tonight she is watching with her mother and so wants something less crude.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Navigation-by-Preference works by making three recommendations. The user must select the one that comes closest to satisfying her short-term
                        interests. Then another round of recommendations is made. This round of recommendations takes into account the feedback learned in the
                        previous round: it tries to recommend movies that are like the one that the user selected and unlike the ones she rejected. This cycle repeats until
                        the user finds a movie she would like to watch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this project, we will extend Navigation-by-Preference by turning it into a game of Snog-Marry-Avoid. The user will decide which movie she wants to snog 
                        (i.e. which one is most like what she wants to see right now), which she wants to marry (i.e. which one is most like her usual tastes) and which she wants to
                        avoid. This sounds simple but, as well as developing the software, we will need to work out ways of revising the formulae that Arpit and I
                        designed, since the existing formulae work in a simpler scenario.

                            See DGB4 but also the student must not be afraid of mathematical formulae. Note, however, these formulae are quite simple: they are just
                            based on such things as the cardinality of the intersection of two sets.

                        In a lot of the work on Machine Learning (ML), the learning algorithm builds a model from large quantities of data, and the model enables the system to make predictions on unseen data. When the training data comes from users, the assumption is that the users are happy to share their data so that it can be used centrally by the ML algorithm. Often, however, users are reluctant to share their data in this way, seeing it as a violation of their privacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A recent article from Google proposes what they call federated learning. Users do not share their data. Rather, each user builds a model locally and shares the parameters that get learned. Centrally, the parameters are averaged and the averages are sent back to the users, who can incorporate them into the next round of local learning. In this project, we will investigate federated learning for ourselves.

                        We will start with a dataset of sensor data about hand gestures and, as a way of beginning our ML journey, we will learn a single model (in traditional fashion) from all the data to predict which hand gesture is depicted. Then we will implement Google's federated learning, as above, on this data. Then, there are a number of possible extensions to the work. One is to implement some new ideas that I have had for averaging the models. Another is to move to more challenging datasets from the domain of human activity recognition, which will need use of more complex neural networks for the learning.

                            ML projects have very steep learning curves. Hence, this project will only suit a good MScDSA student or one of the very best undergrad students. The student must be a good Python programmer and comfortable with mathematical notation.

                            In the case of an MScDSA student, I  would not be willing to supervise someone who intends taking up employment 
                            during the project period.

                        In this project, we will work with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/">Kaggle PetFinder Dataset</a>. This 
                        dataset contains text descriptions and images of cats and dogs, each labeled with a number that represents how long it took before the animal
                        was adopted.

                        The goal is to use Machine Learning techniques to build a system that, given text and images for a new animal, can predict how long it will take
                        for that animal to get adopted.
