Dear FYP students,

The report upload is also managed via http://project.cs.ucc.ie. I have just updated the instructions at http://project.cs.ucc.ie/deliverable/index
So I want you to upload an tgz, tar.gz or zip archive (filename is irrelevant) whose content should match this structure:

contents of archive.tgz:

report.pdf
code/
demo.html

If you have already uploaded your report then please re-upload. As always, you can upload as often as you wish until the due date. Only the most recent file is kept.

F.

FDAT Instructions
Description

Report writing guidelines were given separately. Upload instructions: Prepare a zip or or tar.gz archive with your report as PDF in the folder root and one sub-folder with all source code you wrote as part of your FYP. If you have any online demonstration then create a file with the name demo.html with clickable links and add it also to the root folder of the archive.
