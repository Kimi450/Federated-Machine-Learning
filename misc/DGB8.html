                        In a lot of the work on Machine Learning (ML), the learning algorithm builds a model from large quantities of data, and the model enables the system to make predictions on unseen data. When the training data comes from users, the assumption is that the users are happy to share their data so that it can be used centrally by the ML algorithm. Often, however, users are reluctant to share their data in this way, seeing it as a violation of their privacy.

                        A recent article from Google proposes what they call federated learning. Users do not share their data. Rather, each user builds a model locally and shares the parameters that get learned. Centrally, the parameters are averaged and the averages are sent back to the users, who can incorporate them into the next round of local learning. In this project, we will investigate federated learning for ourselves.

                        We will start with a dataset of sensor data about hand gestures and, as a way of beginning our ML journey, we will learn a single model (in traditional fashion) from all the data to predict which hand gesture is depicted. Then we will implement Google's federated learning, as above, on this data. Then, there are a number of possible extensions to the work. One is to implement some new ideas that I have had for averaging the models. Another is to move to more challenging datasets from the domain of human activity recognition, which will need use of more complex neural networks for the learning.

                            ML projects have very steep learning curves. Hence, this project will only suit a good MScDSA student or one of the very best undergrad students. The student must be a good Python programmer and comfortable with mathematical notation.

                            In the case of an MScDSA student, I  would not be willing to supervise someone who intends taking up employment 
                            during the project period.
